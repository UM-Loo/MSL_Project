# MSL_Project

# SUMMARY:
Sign language understanding has witnessed a surge in importance owing to the rise of
advancements in sign language translation. This surge in importance reflects a broader
recognition of the need for inclusive communication and underscores the role of evolving
technologies in facilitating seamless interaction through sign languages. However, sign
language translation, especially for Malaysian Sign Language (MSL), is in its early stages.
Challenges in developing MSL translation model include limited dataset and low resource
of Neural Machine Translation. 

## Workflow
1. Data Collection
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Deep Learning Model Training

Two branches:
1. Main (Master)
2. data-preprocessing (Dev)

# Malaysian Sign Language Project

This project focuses on Malaysian Sign Language (MSL) translation using data preprocessing and deep learning.

## Project Goals
- Collect and preprocess sign language data
- Train a deep learning model for MSL translation
- Address challenges in low-resource languages

## Repository Structure
- `data_collection/`: Raw videos and metadata
- `data_preprocessing/`: Preprocessing scripts and outputs
- `deep_learning/`: Deep learning models and configurations
- `docs/`: Project documentation
- `scripts/`: Helper scripts

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <https://github.com/UM-Loo/MSL_Project.git>
   cd MSL_Project

# Command to control 
1. git pull
2. git push
3. git merge
