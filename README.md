Malaysian Sign Language - Data Preprocessing

SUMMARY:
Sign language understanding has witnessed a surge in importance owing to the rise of
advancements in sign language translation. This surge in importance reflects a broader
recognition of the need for inclusive communication and underscores the role of evolving
technologies in facilitating seamless interaction through sign languages. However, sign
language translation, especially for Malaysian Sign Language (MSL), is in its early stages.
Challenges in developing MSL translation model include limited dataset and low resource
of Neural Machine Translation.
